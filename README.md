# Portfolio Reflection
The best way to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code is to follow a few guidelines. Make sure that the code is well-commented to make sure that it's easily readable, the other guideline to follow is to make sure the code is modular. That ensures that the code can be easily maintained and adapted.
When working on the Python CRUD module, I made sure that each feature was commented and sequestered into it's own function. That way the code can be easily adapted or modified as needs change.
The CRUD module could be adapted for any MongoDB database in the future, as opposed to simply being used for the AAC database.
When approaching a problem like a computer scientist, I make sure to break it down into the smallest steps that make sense. Then I arrange it into a step-by-step process that I can then follow.
The approach I took on this final project was not *all* that different from my usual approach. I broke the requirements down by feature and then those features down into approachable steps. I then followed those steps to get the most important features completed first, then I finished the other, less important, features afterwards.
It's a process that has worked very well in the past and I plan to continue using it in the future.
Computer scientists are problem solvers at their core. They create solutions through their knowledge of computer systems and programming languages. What they do matters because modern technology is completely and utterly supported by what they do.
My work on this project would help a company like Grazioso Salvare find the data they needed much more easily than if they had to trawl through the MongoDB database at the terminal-level.
